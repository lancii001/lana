<h1>Horses</h1>
<p>As a passion !!!</p>
<p>There is nothing more enjoyable than rising early, saddling your horse, and watching the sun rise as you and your horse move as one through the quiet of the morning. Or imagine galloping across a field at full speed with the wind whipping at your face and your adrenalin rushing. And don´t forget a moon-lite ride with a few friends enjoying each other´s company as the moon lights the way for you. Life just feels right. These are a few examples of the pleasure of riding.</p>

<h2>Reminders</h2>
<p> If you have never ridden a horse before, you are missing out on a wonderful experience. It is a great way of leaving a frustrating day behind you. Once you mount your horse you forget about everything, relax and let your mind wander.
             It becomes just you and him as you trot through the open field. You talk to him, tell him about your day, or just ride quietly together lost in your thoughts.
             As you ride you can become anything you want, a great equestrian rider for the Olympics going for the gold, or a cowboy riding looking for cattle to rustle. It doesn’t=t matter what you choose to dream, the dreams are yours as you ride.
             Unfortunately, there are some people have tried riding and had a bad experience, or have always been fearful of horses and swore never to get on one. If you are one of these people, I urge you to reconsider. There are instructors out there that specialize in the nervous rider, or first time rider. They will take their time with you, taking you as slow or fast as you like. Who knows, maybe you may over come your fear and start enjoying it so much, that soon you will be owning your own horse or two and wondering why you never did this earlier. It can happen!
             Riding is also a great form of exercise. The more you ride the more it will strengthen your arms and legs, it is a great way to stay in shape and enjoy yourself at the same time.</p>
